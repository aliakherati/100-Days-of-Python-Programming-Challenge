# 100 Days of Python Programming Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Programming Challenge repository! This project is inspired by and based on the ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course from Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. While the project scopes are the same as the course, the solutions have been modified by me to enhance my Python programming skills through daily practice and project work.

## Repository Structure

Each day's project is contained in its own folder, named `day-XX-project-name` where XX is the day number (01-100). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file explaining the project
- The project code files
- A `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python packages in the parent directory (if applicable)

## Course Inspiration

This challenge is based on the curriculum of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" from Udemy. You can find the original course here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

While the project ideas and scopes are derived from the course, the implementations and solutions in this repository are my own work, allowing me to practice and demonstrate my Python programming skills.
